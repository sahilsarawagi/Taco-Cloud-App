This README provides a summary of key concepts from the first chapter of the book Spring in action.

## **Controller Annotations in Spring MVC**

### **@Controller Annotation:**
The `@Controller` annotation in Spring designates a class as a controller component. Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests in a Spring web application. When a class is annotated with `@Controller`, Spring identifies it during component scanning, creating an instance as a Spring bean within the application context. These beans are fundamental elements managed by the Spring container.

### **Similar Annotations:**
Apart from `@Controller`, Spring offers other annotations (`@Component`, `@Service`, and `@Repository`) with similar purposes. They all contribute to the component scanning mechanism, making classes available as beans in the Spring context.

### **Handler Method and @GetMapping:**
In Spring MVC, a controller's method (e.g., `home()`) processes HTTP requests. The `@GetMapping` annotation maps an HTTP GET request to this method, providing a route for requests to the root path ("/"). The method returns a logical view name ("home"), interpreted as the template to render.

### **Testing Controllers with @WebMvcTest:**
`@WebMvcTest` is a specialized test annotation in Spring Boot for testing Spring MVC components. It sets up a limited Spring context, focusing only on the MVC components. With the injected `MockMvc` object, HTTP requests can be simulated and assertions can be made about the responses.

## **Template Caching in Web Development**

### **Template Engines and Caching:**
Template engines like Thymeleaf and FreeMarker process templates into internal representations. To enhance performance, these engines cache parsed templates in memory. Cached templates improve production performance by reducing the overhead of template parsing.
